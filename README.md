# Blockchains For Business Networks
My undergraduate project at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr. Shweta Agrawal. The problem statment is aimed to provide distributed, permissioned consensus using proof of stake to different entities in a multi party network.
I used [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) to create a permissioned blockchain environment.
