This folder contains all the work done by me for my B. Tech Project, EE4900, under my guide, Dr Shweta Agrawal and my co-guide Dr Krishna Jagannathan. I have explored the idea of using Blockchains for general purpose ledger service. I generated two business networks, one which contains the details of undergraduate students currently pursuing Electrical Engineering in IIT Madras and the other has land details which are generated virtually.

Files and Folders present :-

startFabric.sh - Bash file useful for starting the Hyperledger Fabric so that a network can be built upon it.
createPeerAdminCard.sh - Bash file used for creating an admin of peers(virtual) present in the local network.
